==========================================
+ Added Growthcraft Community Edition by Gwafu, IceDragon200, alatyami and Sunconure11

CraftMine v4 Beta 1 - Build 0034 changelog (06/11/2015)
==========================================
+ Added Tinker's Construct and its required library called "Mantle" by boni
* Updated the disclaimer text on the menu to reflect that we're now in beta and minor bugs are to be expected
* Changed disclaimer text from red to yellow
* Configured Tinker's Construct to make it more balanced
+ Added IguanaTinkerTweaks by boni
* Configured IguanaTinkerTweaks to rebalance the rebalancing mod (wow... XD) and to rebalance Tinker's Construct some more

==========================================
+ Added DecoCraft2 by RazzleberryFox again

+ [Rapido+] Switched default Optifine chunk loading mode from "Default" to "Smooth" for less chunk loading and rendering lag spikes
+ Added CrayTokensLite by Paint_Ninja

CraftMine v4 Alpha 3 - Build 0032 changelog (29/10/2015-01/11/2015)
===========================================
+* Revised menu design and new layout, allowing for most of the elements to fit on the main menu at 854x480 width and height (MC's default non-maximised size) and a more streamlined UI
+ New mod list menu with an explanation as to why mods aren't the only thing that makes CM work the way it does
* Marked It's the little things mod as tested and stable, in compliance with our naming convention
+ Added Et Futurum by ganymedes01 (adds #27)
* Disabled retrogen in MrTJPCore to prevent retrogen from occuring for ProjectRed in already generated chunks with the mod's stuff. It appears that the mod's buggy causing the retrogen to occur every single time the internal server is started, eventually causing everything to just be the mod's stuff.
+ Added Safe mod originally by AUTOMATIC_MAIDEN, now maintained by kamilx3, as the lag spikes from this mod in the past have now been fixed!
+ Added Model Citizens by FyberOptic
* Turned up atmospheric MAtmos volume by 7%

#+ Brand new branding by "Jakob Hartley - Bate" aka Mr_Effex and Paint_Ninja with a new vision for the pack and concepts based on this design
+ Brand new menu design, based on the new branding concepts!
* Reduced filesize by about 8-9MB by removing redundant, unused menu backgrounds
* This is the second early access build, with quite a lot of gameplay additions and improvements over the last EA build!
#* Reduced filesize even more by about 33MB by purging the BetterRecords cache from when I tested it with tonnes of long, high-quality music tracks

CraftMine v4 Alpha 3 - Build 0030 changelog (24/10/2015)
===========================================
+ Added UtilityMobs by FatherToast
+ Added NoShelter by TheDespite, finishes implementing #26
* Configured NoShelter so that invasions happen every 10 nights instead of every 2 and so that mobs cannot grief. (Needs testing)
* Configured NoShelter so that the number of enemies that spawn at once during an invasion is less than the default so it's not too laggy
+ Added SurvivalTweaks (#28)
* Configured SurvivalTweaks so the nether no longer punishs you too harshly just for breaking any block there

CraftMine v4 Alpha 3 - Build 0029 changelog (23/10/2015-24/10/2015)
===========================================
+ Added SpecialAI by FatherToast (partially implements #26)
* Configured SpecialAI so that mob greifing doesn't happen but torch snapping still can
* Configured SpecialAI so that zombies can have special abilities, too!
* Decided to turn off mob greifing-related behaviour entirely until better planned out
* Made mobs harder by making special abilities more common and some other config tweaks in SpecialAI
X Tried adding DamageIndicators by rich1051414 but failed due to the official downloads being taken down or made private by the author. We'll be looking into other ways of getting the official mod in the meantime.
+ Added Pam's Harvestcraft by Pamela Collins
* Marked SpecialAI as tested and stable, in compliance with the naming convention
* Updated YAMPST tracker to show the correct build on the stats
X Tried TabbyChat mod by RocketMan10404 but removed it for now due to it not being as simple as I initially hoped. :(

* Enabled Chisel's alternative recipe

+ Added BetterRecords by Stumblinbear
+ Added Presence Footsteps by Huricaaane and Sollace
* [Rapido+] Configured Presence Footsteps so that it works properly and doesn't show the broken update notification (I've added the latest version but the

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0012 changelog (09/09/2015-12/09/2015)

- [CM Belle] Removed some redundant textures to lower the filesize a bit
+ [CM Belle] Made the loading screen background texture (1 of 2)

+ [CM Belle] Added CraftMine logo texture for the default title screen

===========================================
+ Added SimpleOres official "Fusion" plugin
X Tried adding CraftGuide litemod by Uristqwerty but failed
+ Added CraftGuide forgemod by Uristqwerty
- Undone all Rapido+ optimisations for Ninja's Cash, BetterFoliage and Optifine. It turns out the optimisations weren't lossless for the textures and caused ugly visual glitches. >.< However, BetterFPS will keep its
optimisations because it does not contain any textures and is therefore truely lossless.

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0010 changelog (05/09/2015)
===========================================
+ Added Buildcraft core v7.0.22
+ Added Buildcraft transport v7.0.22

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0009 changelog (31/08/2015-05/09/2015)
===========================================
# Based on b0007
+ Added Bibliocraft
* Tried setting BetterFPS back to Vanilla Algorithm to solve incompatibilities (didn't seem to work)
- Removed BetterFPS and Fastcraft entirely to try to see if that helps stop the lag spikes due to incompatibilities (didn't seem to work either)
* Doubled RAM and PermGen allocation to try to solve lag spikes (WORKED! :D)
* Changed minimum requirements to reflect the lag spikes solution
+ Added in Fastcraft and BetterFPS again
* Set BetterFPS' algorithm back to "Riven's Algorithm" for improved performance
+ Added YAMPST anonymous tracker in again
* Updated YAMPST so that it shows the actual build version this time rather than just "v4-Alpha2" so that bug reports collected are more useful

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0008 changelog (31/08/2015)
===========================================
+ Added Buildcraft core
* [Rapido+] Optimised Buildcraft's core networking to help prevent lag spikes on internal server (upload interval set to every 250ms instead of every 500ms).
* Set voxelMap default size from "Regular" to "Small" (slight performance improvement)
+ Added Buildcraft transport
* Buildcraft transport seems to be causing lag spikes too now... After further investigation I found that the BetterFPS mod was causing these lag spikes with Buildcraft.
Setting the BetterFPS mod to use the Vanilla algorithm lowered the fps but seemed to have stopped the lag spikes, indicating an incompatibility with the Buildcraft & BetterFPS mods.
* Buildcraft has too many lag spikes that I can't seem to be able to resolve. Making a new build based on b0007 to remove Buildcraft stuff. :(

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0007 changelog (31/08/2015)
===========================================
+ Added SimpleCore and SimpleOres2 by AleXndrTheGr8st

===========================================
# Based on b0003
+ Added Carpenter's Blocks by Mineshopper
* Found out that Bibliocraft was causing the frequent major lag spikes. Bibliocraft will not be included in the pack until this mod's major bug is resolved.
+ Added VoxelMap by MamiyaOtaru
* [Rapido+] Configured VoxelMap for better gameplay mechanics and slightly better performance
+ Added InvTweaks by Kobata

CraftMine v4 Alpha 2 - Build 0005 changelog (30/08/2015)
===========================================
+ Added SimpleCore and SimpleOres2 by AleXndrTheGr8st
+ Added SimpleOres2 official Fusion and Netherrocks plugins
- Temporarily removed the fusion & netherrocks plugins, simplecore, simpleores2, buildcraft and safe mods until I sort out a major constant lag spike issue
* Working hard on identifying what's causing the major lag spikes that happen constantly
! Unable to identify the cause of the major lag spikes. I'm forced to make a new build based on b0004 or even b0003! D:
